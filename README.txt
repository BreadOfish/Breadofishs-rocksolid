how to open, edit, and play:
=============================
download the zip file from your branch of choice, and then open IntelliJ IDEA. Use the file tab to select the folder (remember to unzip it first), and now you have the source code loaded. 

Most of the files you downloaded are detected to forge, the actual mod files are located in src/main. The textures and Json files are located in the resource folder, and the code is in the java folder.

To play it inside IntelliJ, open the "gradle" tab, and click the option that says "client" on it. It should open minecraft and you will be able to play it like normal.

Mapping Names:
=============================
By default, the MDK is configured to use the official mapping names from Mojang for methods and fields 
in the Minecraft codebase. These names are covered by a specific license. All modders should be aware of this
license, if you do not agree with it you can change your mapping names to other crowdsourced names in your 
build.gradle. For the latest license text, refer to the mapping file itself, or the reference copy here:
